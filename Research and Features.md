# Research & Features

## Initial Research:

Post example websites for fish tank management below and list things you like or dislike about them:

* [Aquaruium Note for Android]
  * Not very user friendly
  * No tutorial
  * Reviews say app crashes
  * Not beginner friendly-- you need to know things about keeping fish already for this to be any use for you
  * You can set recurring alarms and reminders for yourself
  * You can keep records of your pH, CO2, and other things
  * Just a glorified record keeping app-- you can't specify species and it doesn't help you learn things.
    * I tried to put a clownfish in a freshwater tank, the app saw no problems
    
* [Aquaruium Manager for Android]
  * Reviews say only allows for two tanks
  * Reviews say app crashes often
  * Detailed database, but you have to know what you're looking for
    * No "browse" with pictures or anything, you have to type things in and use the auto complete
    * However, when adding fish you can type in the section you know - common name or scientific name - and it auto populates the rest
  * Still does not tell you not to put clownfish in freshwater tanks
  * HORRIBLE contrast at times
  * Does have a simple tutorial
  * Good record keeping and includes a diary for miscellaneous notes
  
* [Aquarimate for Apple]
  * Was not able to download it due to technology and paywall-- all these observations based on reviews and info page
  * Detailed charts for personal records
  * Task manager and reminder system
  * Much better looking database with pictures and information and helpful hints about fish species
  * Skims information from Amazon for food, suppliments, and other products
  * Includes calculators, converters, and expenses
  * Seems really solid, possibly worth the $10 it costs
  
## Features List:

This will be the Product Backlog for your initial sprints. List different features you'd like to implement here:

* [Database Skimming]
  * Maybe it can skim info from wikipedia or a reputable fish website, so it can auto populate info
    * Theoretically at that point it would be able to understand whether a fish is freshwater or saltwater, and other relevant information

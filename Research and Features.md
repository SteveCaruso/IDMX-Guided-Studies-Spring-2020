# Research & Features

## Initial Research:

Post example websites for fish tank management below and list things you like or dislike about them:

* [Aquaruium Note for Android]
  * Not very user friendly
  * No tutorial
  * Reviews say app crashes
  * Not beginner friendly-- you need to know things about keeping fish already for this to be any use for you
  * You can set recurring alarms and reminders for yourself
  * You can keep records of your pH, CO2, and other things
  * Just a glorified record keeping app-- you can't specify species and it doesn't help you learn things.
    * I tried to put a clownfish in a freshwater tank, the app saw no problems
    
* [Aquaruium Manager for Android]
  * Reviews say only allows for two tanks
  * Reviews say app crashes often
  * Detailed database, but you have to know what you're looking for
    * No "browse" with pictures or anything, you have to type things in and use the auto complete
    * However, when adding fish you can type in the section you know - common name or scientific name - and it auto populates the rest
  * Still does not tell you not to put clownfish in freshwater tanks
  * HORRIBLE contrast at times
  * Does have a simple tutorial
  * Good record keeping and includes a diary for miscellaneous notes
  
* [Aquarimate for Apple]
  * Was not able to download it due to technology and paywall-- all these observations based on reviews and info page
  * Detailed charts for personal records
  * Task manager and reminder system
  * Much better looking database with pictures and information and helpful hints about fish species
  * Skims information from Amazon for food, suppliments, and other products
  * Includes calculators, converters, and expenses
  * Seems really solid, possibly worth the $10 it costs
  
* [Coral Tank Pro for Apple]
  * Was not able to download it due to technology and paywall-- all these observations based on reviews and info page
  * Very pretty high contrast design
  * Lots of pictures
  * Charts and analytics
  * Reviews say it's like a 3 out of 5
    * Not sufficient for pros, basically a "frilly notepad"
    * Needs more customization
  
  
Initial Research Christopher Hurban: 

Fish Farm 3- 3D Aquarium Simulator for Android

•	The fish are realistic looking (all the fish in the game have moving gills and fishes bellies are allowed to grow). 

•	All of the fish are colored and easy to determine what species of fish that they are.

•	The player has the option to zoom into the tank to see your fish at a better angle. 

•	Each tank aquarium is able to be customizable with decorative items such as plants that survive in water and each aquarium can also have coral. 

•	The player is easily able to catch fish with just their fingers (very simple).

•	Within the simulator a player can catch the following seahorses, whales, dolphins, sharks, starfish, jellyfish, and turtles.

•	Has a straightforward game tutorial. 

•	If the player doesn’t change the water from their tank, then the fish will soon die since of the condition of the tank. 

•	Recolored fish cannot be used to breed for your Collection. (I think that a player should be able to recolor their fish especially when they are breeding the fish. It would make it easier for the player to keep track of. 

•	The simulator has the following options to add to the game. The options are as stated: Saltwater, freshwater, jelly, and open ocean aquariums. Each one of these would offer each fish a better chance of surviving. (Since some fish can only live in certain kinds of water). Some will die If they are in a different kind of water. 

•	The game has is very colorful. It is easy for the player to determine which tank and which tank that they are feeding.

•	Feeding fish is very easy to do. All the player has to do is tap on the certain fish that they want to feed and then that fish will no longer have a craving for food. 

•	The tanks also have lights which make it easy to see inside of the tank. I think that the lights could have more options like having any color available to each and every player. Each player will most likely want a different color to add to their tank.

•	This app simulator of the fish tank is very well done and I think it’s a really great app especially for being a free app both on the Google Play Store and The Apple App Store. 



Aquarium Fish for Android: 

•	The aquarium has nice and very easy to see graphics.

•	Simple to use user interface

•	This app allows you to easily configure the size of the tank that you want to have. 

•	Different types of plants are able to be grown within the aquarium. 

•	The water changes color and will also become dirty just like an actual fish tank. 

•	The tank will also change temperature. The user has be careful that their fish in that tank are healthy. 

•	The fish multiply just like in real life. The fish will multiply within the aquarium and some will stay alive and then the other fish will die off. 

•	Many kinds of fish that are available to purchase within the game store. 

•	This app has a function called Acceleration which is pressed in order to speed up the events taking place in the app.

•	There are no limits on the amount of decorations or plants, or equipment offered in a tank. I find that a very cool feature to have on a app aquarium. 

•	The user is allowed to put in as many fish as they want to have within the fish tank. 

•	User is also allowed to have unlimited number of fish tanks on their app. 

•	The interactions made with just the press of your finger as the player will affect the fish and the tank that those fish are in. 


## Features List:

This will be the Product Backlog for your initial sprints. List different features you'd like to implement here:

* [Database Skimming]
  * Maybe it can skim info from wikipedia or a reputable fish website, so it can auto populate info
    * Theoretically at that point it would be able to understand whether a fish is freshwater or saltwater, and other relevant information
